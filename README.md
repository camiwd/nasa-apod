# Nasa - Astronomy picture of the day
ReactJS assignment - create a small application.

Currently the page is only showing the APOD (Astronomy picture of the day) of the current date we are in. The idea is to add a feature where the user also can view pictures from previous dates. 

## Preview
<img src="./src/media/nasa.png" width="100%"> 

## Installation
- Clone the repository: 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/camiwd/nasa-apod
```
- Run the following command in the project directory to start a local server:
```
$ npm start
```
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
